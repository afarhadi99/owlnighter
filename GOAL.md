# 🎯 owlnighter — Build Goal & Progress

**Goal:** Implement the full platform described in
[`docs/reading-research.md`](docs/reading-research.md) — a Flutter reader app, a
Next.js admin console, and a Fastify API over Supabase, with Gemini grounding,
Groq low-latency generation, Deepgram TTS, and FCM push — as a coherent,
inspectable, honestly-scoped monorepo.

This file is the **living checklist**. It is updated as each piece lands.

**Live repo:** https://github.com/afarhadi99/owlnighter (public) — pushed 2026-07-08.

## Environment reality check (surfaced up front)

| Capability | State | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node / pnpm / TypeScript | ✅ | installed & used to verify TS builds |
| Docker | ✅ | available for local Postgres/Supabase |
| Flutter / Dart SDK | ✅ 3.44.5 / Dart 3.12.2 | installed; **builds Android debug APK** |
| Android SDK | ✅ build-capable | platforms 34/36, build-tools ≤36.1.0, AVD `Medium_Phone` |
| GitHub `gh` CLI / token | ❌ | repo publish requires a decision with the owner |
| Gemini + Groq keys | ✅ | pulled from sibling repos into local `.env` |
| Supabase / Deepgram / FCM | 🟡 local | placeholders per instruction; wire real creds later |

## Component build status

The whole architecture is now scaffolded. TypeScript is built & verified; the
Flutter tree is authored but can't compile here (no SDK).

| Component | Path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contracts (Zod → OpenAPI) | `packages/ts/contracts` | ✅ builds · OpenAPI emits 11 paths |
| Shared (env/log/ids/flags) | `packages/ts/shared` | ✅ builds |
| DB (Drizzle + SQL/RLS/pgvector) | `packages/ts/db` + `infra/sql` | ✅ builds |
| AI router (Gemini + Groq) | `packages/ts/ai` | ✅ builds · 4/4 unit tests pass |
| Jobs (TTS/reminders) | `packages/ts/jobs` | ✅ builds |
| Fastify API (11 routes) | `apps/api` | ✅ typechecks · inject smoke test passes |
| Next.js admin console | `apps/admin` | ✅ `next build` compiles (11 routes) |
| Flutter app + Dart pkgs | `apps/mobile` + `packages/dart/*` | ✅ **runs on emulator** · dev-auth + live API (library loads) · APK builds · analyze-clean · widget tests pass |
| Infra (Docker/CloudRun/FCM) | `infra/*` | 🟡 authored — YAML valid, not deployed |
| CI (GitHub Actions) | `.github/workflows` | ✅ mirrors local green checks |

**Full-workspace `pnpm -r build`: green (all 8 TS/Next projects).**

### End-to-end verification (2026-07-08)

Ran the real API against local Postgres (`:55432`) + live Gemini/Groq keys. The
**entire reading loop passed**: `books/search` (Google Books + Open Library merge)
→ `books/ground` (Gemini, confidence 0.95, `pageLevelUnsafe` honoured) →
`library/books` → `plans/generate` (Gemini, real chapters) → `steps/:id/quiz`
(router auto-fell-back Groq→Gemini) → `quiz/:id/submit` → **passed 4/4, streak=1,
+20 XP**. Two real bugs found + fixed along the way (grounded-prompt shape;
missing book identity in the plan prompt). See `docs/local-dev.md` to reproduce.

### Round 2 — parallel testing + implementation (2026-07-09)

Fanned out 3 agents on disjoint domains (opus/high for mobile + backend,
sonnet/medium for admin). Results, all **verified by the controller**:
- **Mobile:** Android platform generated; **`flutter build apk --debug` → 212 MB APK**;
  11 widget tests pass; analyze clean. Android SDK now build-capable (AVD present).
- **Backend:** 5 new endpoints (openapi now **15 paths**) — library list, step-start,
  admin metrics/tts/quiz-invalidate; migration `0003` (quiz invalidation); Deepgram
  TTS wired with graceful 503. **15/15 node:test** pass; all 5 endpoints exercised
  **live against Postgres** (200s).
- **Admin:** Overview + TTS inspector + Quiz-QA wired to the live endpoints; `next build` compiles.

### Round 3 — runs on device (2026-07-10)

Fanned out 3 more agents (opus/high mobile + backend, sonnet/med admin).
- **Mobile:** dev-auth + `10.0.2.2` emulator host + core loop wired to real repos.
  **VERIFIED ON DEVICE (emulator-5554):** app launches → boots past auth →
  `GET /healthz` + `GET /v1/library/books` return **200 over 10.0.2.2** → the
  seeded book renders in "Your library". analyze clean; 7 widget tests pass; APK builds.
- **Backend:** `GET /v1/admin/plans`, `GET /v1/admin/quizzes`, FCM HTTP v1 push
  (service-account JWT via node:crypto, graceful `not_configured`), `POST
  /v1/admin/push/test`. openapi now **18 paths**; **20/20** tests.
- **Admin:** Plans QA + Quiz QA wired to the live list endpoints.
- Known follow-up: the library-list endpoint returns book ids, not titles — the
  card shows "Book 3ce25e75". Enrich `LibraryBooksResponse` with title/author/cover.

### Round 4 — Phase 4 + test-all (2026-07-10)

Fanned out 3 agents (opus/high backend + mobile, sonnet/med admin), then a full
controller regression + live e2e + on-device drive.
- **Library enriched** (title/author/cover via join) — VERIFIED on emulator:
  the card now reads "The Left Hand of Darkness / Ursula K. Le Guin".
- **Tests added:** backend **63** (inject tests for every endpoint + units) and
  **70 dart** (app_core round-trips, offline cache/SyncQueue, widgets). Full
  regression green: `pnpm -r build`+typecheck, 63 api tests, 5-pkg analyze, 70
  flutter tests, APK builds.
- **Backend fix (found by testing):** `DEV_USER_ID` wasn't a valid UUID → `z.uuid()`
  rejected it in bodies (push/test 400). Changed to a valid v4 across the codebase;
  migrated the seeded dev data; push/test now validates + degrades cleanly.
- **Admin:** notifications "send test push"; honest states elsewhere.
- **⚠️ On-device finding:** plan generation via Gemini took **~58s** (v3 persisted
  server-side), which **exceeds the mobile Dio timeout** — the book-tap spins then
  silently returns to Library without navigating, and the app **regenerates a plan
  on every open** (no get-or-create). Top phase-5 item: make plan generation
  async/faster + get-or-create + a real loading/error state on the path screen.

### Round 5 — THE FULL LOOP RUNS ON DEVICE (2026-07-10)

Fanned out 3 agents (backend get-or-create + Groq-first plans; mobile launcher
UX + motion; CI/docs hardening), then drove the complete loop on emulator-5554:

**library (title) → path map (opened in <1s via plan reuse — was 58s timeout) →
nightly session (`steps/:id/start` 200) → 4-question Gemini quiz about the real
book (Genly Ai, the Ekumen, kemmering, the ice) → submit 200 →
"Nice reading tonight!" 4/4 correct · 🔥 1-day streak · ⚡ +20 XP.**

- `GET /v1/plans?bookId=` + `ifExists:"reuse"` (default): live reuse in **292ms**,
  no AI call. Plans now Groq-first (blueprint two-pass), Gemini fallback.
- Mobile PlanLauncher: instant open for existing plans; "Crafting your nightly
  path…" + retryable error for fresh ones. 74 dart tests (4 new).
- CI: Flutter analyze/test now **blocking** across all packages; api suite in CI.
- Suites: **68 backend + 74 dart tests green**; openapi **19 paths**; APK builds.

**Stage 1 (core reading loop) acceptance is now fully verified on device.**
Stage 4 (motion) partially verified live: path nodes, card transitions,
celebration + haptics. Remaining: Rive flame asset, XP overlay flourish,
frame profiling.

### Round 6 — SVG art + sound (2026-07-12)

Delegated to opus (design_system art → mobile SFX/integration pipeline) and
sonnet (admin), then verified on device:
- **design_system/art:** five SVG-path CustomPainter widgets — NightSky (seeded
  twinkling stars + crescent moon), OwlMascot (idle/cheer/sleepy — the mascot
  exists!), FlameFlicker (3-layer organic flame; StreakFlame now delegates to it,
  Rive placeholder retired), ConfettiBurst (physics particles), PathScenery.
  All reduced-motion safe. +20 widget tests (suite 33).
- **mobile:** six original synthesized WAV SFX (tools/gen_sfx.mjs) + SfxService
  with a persisted Settings toggle; art wired into path map (night sky + moon),
  nightly (sleepy owl), quiz (tap/correct/wrong cues), celebration (confetti +
  cheering owl + flame + fanfare). Dart suite now **106 tests**.
- **admin:** inline-SVG blinking OwlLogo, count-up StatTiles, orbiting-star
  spinner, WebAudio chimes (no assets), reduced-motion + mute respected.
- **ON DEVICE:** starfield path map with the wave-5 chapter shown as a green ✓
  node, sleepy owl on the nightly screen, and a real 4/4 pass ending in the
  cheering owl + flame celebration (submit 200; streak intact).
- Known cosmetic follow-up: NightSky on the nightly screen covers only the top
  content area (bottom half plain) — extend the backdrop to full height.

### Round 7 — user audit: "far from Duolingo" (2026-07-12)

User audit (on-device, every screen) called out real gaps: cheap synthesized
sounds, no per-question feedback (batch-only quiz), the celebration sheet
**dead-ended** instead of returning to the path, streak tab hardcoded to 0,
flat non-tactile UI, dead Settings rows, bare add-book search results.
Fanned out sonnet (backend) + opus (design-system → mobile pipeline), fixed
every finding, verified **on device end-to-end**:

- **Backend:** `GET /v1/me/stats` (real streak/XP/7-day week) + `POST
  /v1/quiz/:id/check` (instant per-question verdict, key stays server-side;
  final `submit` unchanged). 74/74 tests, openapi 21 paths.
- **design_system "juice kit":** ChunkyButton (3D pressed-edge), PathNode v2
  (glow + bobbing START callout + green-check completed + amber in-progress
  arc), FeedbackBanner, JuicyProgressBar, XpCounter, StatCard. 54 tests.
- **mobile:** sound synthesis rewritten (detuned ensembles, harmonic-partial
  decay physics, lowpass, echo, saturation — still fully original/synthesized);
  quiz is now select→CHECK→banner+SFX→CONTINUE per question; a real full-screen
  **CompletionPage** (confetti/owl/XP roll-up/stat cards) whose CONTINUE
  **returns to Library and refreshes the plan**; streak tab hydrated; nightly
  sky full-height; Settings/add-book/library polish. 42 mobile tests (dart
  total **137**).
- **VERIFIED ON DEVICE, full loop, this round:** tapped an available path node
  → 4 questions each with live CHECK → green/red FeedbackBanner → CONTINUE →
  **CompletionPage** (100% accuracy, +20 XP, streak 1) → CONTINUE → **Library**
  → re-opened path → **finished node green, next node glowing START**. The
  "doesn't go anywhere" complaint is closed.

### Round 8 — back-nav, real notifications, home-screen widget (2026-07-12)

User flagged: reading path had no way back to the library, the app bar showed
a black band, wanted more owl animation, real push notifications, and a
Duolingo-style home-screen widget reacting to time-of-day/streak-danger (own
art only, never Duolingo's assets). Fanned out design-system + a 3-stage
mobile pipeline, then personally re-drove the exact broken repro on device:

- **design_system:** `NightScaffold` — the root fix for the black band. Every
  screen now gets a real `night900` background + `extendBodyBehindAppBar`
  instead of each screen patching a transparent-AppBar workaround. Owl mascot
  gained jittered non-periodic blink/head-tilt idle motion and a new
  `OwlState.greet` (wired into the add-book sheet's empty state). 175 dart
  tests total (up from 137).
- **mobile:** every screen wrapped in `NightScaffold`; new `AdaptiveBackButton`
  (pop when possible, else fall back to Library) on the reading path, nightly
  session, and completion screens so none of them dead-end, including after
  the stack-replacing post-quiz `go()`. Local daily reminders
  (`flutter_local_notifications` + `timezone`) with a live Settings toggle +
  time picker; best-effort FCM token registration gated behind try/catch so
  the app still boots without a `google-services.json` in dev. A native
  Kotlin `AppWidgetProvider` + `home_widget` bridge renders a day/evening/
  night/done state from real streak data, updated at boot and after quiz
  submit.
- **VERIFIED ON DEVICE, this round:** the "can't tap the available node"
  investigation turned out to be my own coordinate drift (repeated
  tap/swipe attempts had scrolled the path), not an app bug — confirmed via
  `uiautomator dump` ground-truth bounds, then re-drove the full repro:
  Library → path → node → session → 4-question quiz (each CHECK verified
  against `/v1/quiz/:id/check`) → **CompletionPage** (100% accuracy, +20 XP,
  streak 1) → CONTINUE (stack-replacing `go()`) → path now shows the node
  green and the next one glowing START → **back arrow → Library**, closing
  the back-nav dead-end in exactly the scenario that used to break it. Also
  confirmed live: the Nightly-reminder toggle schedules a real Android
  `RTC_WAKEUP` alarm and updates its subtitle to "Every day at 8:00 PM"; the
  home-screen widget placed via the launcher's widget picker renders our own
  owl/moon/flame art and correctly flips to the green "Nicely done tonight —
  1-day streak and counting" state right after the quiz that was just
  completed. FCM remote delivery is code-complete but untested here (no
  Firebase project on this machine) — local notifications are fully real
  and verified.

### Round 9 — mood-reactive owl faces + header audit (2026-07-12)

User asked for the owl icon to be dynamic (angry if the lesson isn't done)
and for a full-app pass to catch any "weird headers." Ran a 3-agent workflow
(design-system + Android in parallel, mobile wiring after) and personally
audited all 12 page files' headers before dispatching, then reviewed every
diff and re-verified on device:

- **design_system:** two additive `OwlState` values — `worried` (concerned
  eyebrows, mild bob) and `angry` (furrowed frown, squinted glare, a small
  tense shake) — both collapsing to a static pose under reduced motion.
  design_system: 67 tests (+4). mobile: 66 tests (+6, incl. a widget test
  asserting the angry mood banner renders `OwlState.angry`).
- **Android widget:** the home-screen widget's owl glyph now changes face to
  match its existing 4-state model — happy (done, blush cheeks), neutral
  (day), worried (evening), angry (night, streak about to die) — via three
  new vector drawables wired into `ReadingWidgetProvider.applyState`.
- **mobile:** new `owlMoodFor()` helper reuses the widget's own day/evening/
  night bucketing so the in-app owl and the widget owl always agree; wired
  into a new mood banner on the Streaks tab. Header audit found one real bug
  — `plan_launcher_page.dart` (hit every time a book is opened) was still a
  bare `Scaffold+AppBar`, flashing the wrong light-Material theme instead of
  `NightScaffold` — fixed. Also deleted `notifications_page.dart`, a dead,
  unrouted screen with the same wrong-theme AppBar, superseded by the real
  reminder toggle in Settings.
- **VERIFIED ON DEVICE, this round:** rebuilt and installed the APK; the
  Streaks tab's mood banner shows the cheerful owl + "Nicely done tonight!"
  after finishing a reading; the home-screen widget's owl now visibly shows
  blush cheeks in its done state (zoomed screenshot); and forcing the
  `plan_launcher_page.dart` error state live (searched/added a new book) now
  renders in the correct night theme with a working back button — before
  this fix it would have flashed the old bare white AppBar. The angry/
  worried states are exercised by dedicated widget tests (asserting the
  exact `OwlState`) since reaching them live would require rooting the
  emulator to move its clock past midnight.

## Stage 0 — Foundation scaffold  ✅

- ✅ Monorepo layout (`apps/`, `packages/ts/`, `packages/dart/`, `infra/`)
- ✅ Root config: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `melos.yaml`, `tsconfig.base.json`, lint/format
- ✅ `.gitignore` (secrets-safe), `.env.example`, local `.env` with keys
- ✅ `README.md`, `LICENSE`, this `GOAL.md`
- ✅ `packages/ts/contracts` — Zod schemas → JSON Schema → OpenAPI (**verified**: emits 11 paths)
- ✅ `packages/ts/shared` — env parsing, logging, ids, feature flags (**verified**: builds)
- ✅ `packages/ts/db` — Drizzle schema + `infra/sql` migrations (RLS, pgvector) (**verified**: builds)
- ✅ git init on `main` + 4 granular commits

**Acceptance:** ✅ TS packages typecheck; contracts emit a valid OpenAPI doc.

## Stage 1 — Core reading loop  🟡 (API path verified e2e; Flutter UI unrun)

- ✅ Book search (Google Books + Open Library merge) — **verified**
- ✅ Reading plan creation + steps — **verified** (real chapters)
- 🟡 Path screen with unlockable nodes — Flutter authored, not compiled
- ✅ Nightly step → quiz generate/submit — **verified** end-to-end
- ✅ Streak update logic — **verified** (streak=1, +20 XP on pass)
- 🟡 Offline cache for current step + quiz (drift) — Flutter authored, needs codegen

**Acceptance:** ✅ add a book → generated path; ✅ quiz completion updates streak.
Remaining: offline render (Flutter) + admin plan/quiz-provenance inspection UI wiring.

## Stage 2 — Grounding & quality layer  🟡 (pipeline verified)

- ✅ Gemini grounding pipeline + provenance tables — **verified** (persists runs/sources/facts)
- ✅ Confidence scoring + buckets (auto/review/limited) — **verified**
- ✅ `quizMode` derivation + clamping to grounding guarantee — **verified** (`fallback` when weak)
- ✅ Groq→Gemini invalid-output retry/fallback — **verified** (quiz fell back automatically)
- 🟡 Admin review-queue UI — page exists, list endpoints still TODO

**Acceptance:** ✅ books carry a grounding status; ✅ facts have source provenance;
✅ no fake page-specificity (`pageLevelUnsafe` → `partial`/`fallback`). Admin
review-queue wiring remains.

## Stage 3 — Audio, push & habit reinforcement  ⬜

- ⬜ FCM/APNs registration + send pipeline
- ⬜ Local notification fallback
- ⬜ Deepgram pre-generation + caching (Supabase Storage + `tts_assets`)
- ⬜ `just_audio` playback for recap clips
- ⬜ Bedtime reminder + streak-warning rules

**Acceptance:** nightly reminders deep-link into the correct step; recap clips play
from cache offline; push tokens rotate without duplication.

## Stage 4 — Motion & premium polish  ⬜

- ⬜ Rive streak flame / reward badge states
- ⬜ Lesson card transitions, path-node unlock animations
- ⬜ Reward overlays + haptics
- ⬜ Reduced-motion compliance

**Acceptance:** consistent microinteractions; motion honors "reduce motion"; no
dropped-frame hotspots on core flows.

## Stage 5 — Admin hardening & ops  ⬜

- ⬜ Grounding review queue, plan/quiz QA, TTS cache inspector
- ⬜ Model routing controls, user-support actions
- ⬜ Analytics + tracing dashboards

**Acceptance:** operators can explain why a title grounded the way it did, disable
or regenerate content, and diagnose provider incidents without app rebuilds.
